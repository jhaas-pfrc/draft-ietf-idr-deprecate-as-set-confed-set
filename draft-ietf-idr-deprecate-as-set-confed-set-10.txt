                      Deprecation of AS_SET in BGP
             draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-set-confed-set-10

Abstract

   BCP 172 (i.e., RFC 6472) recommends not using AS_SET and
   AS_CONFED_SET AS_PATH segment types in the Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP).  This document advances that recommendation to a standards
   requirement in BGP; it proscribes the use of the AS_SET and
   AS_CONFED_SET path segment typess in the AS_PATH.  This is done to
   simplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make the
   semantics of the originator of a BGP route clearer.  This will also
   simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of various BGP
   security mechanisms.  This document, if approved, updates RFC 4271
   and RFC 5065, and obsoletes RFC 6472.

1.  Introduction

   BCP 172 [RFC6472] makes a recommendation for not using AS_SET (see
   [RFC4271]) and AS_CONFED_SET (see [RFC5065]) AS_PATH path segment
   types in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  This document advances
   the BCP recommendation to a standards requirement in BGP; it
   proscribes the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of path
   segments in the AS_PATH.  The purpose is to simplify the design and
   implementation of BGP and to make the semantics of the originator of

   a BGP route clearer.  This will also simplify the design,
   implementation, and deployment of various BGP security mechanisms.
   In particular, the proscription of AS_SETs and AS_CONFED_SETs removes
   the possibility of ambiguity about origin AS in RPKI-based route
   origin validation (RPKI-ROV) [RFC6811] [RFC6907] [RFC9319].

   The AS_SET path segment in the AS_PATH attribute (Sections 4.3 and
   5.1.2 of [RFC4271]) is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) that contributing prefixes in the aggregate have traversed.

   The AS_CONFED_SET path segment (see [RFC5065]) in the AS_PATH
   attribute is created by a router that is performing route aggregation
   and contains an unordered set of Member AS Numbers in the local
   confederation that contributing prefixes in the aggregate have
   traversed.  It is very similar to an AS_SET but is used within a
   confederation.

   By performing aggregation, a router is combining multiple BGP routes
   for more specific destinations into a new route for a less specific
   destination ([RFC4271], Section 9.1.2.2.).  Aggregation may blur the
   semantics of the origin AS for the prefix being announced by
   producing an AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET.  Such sets can cause
   operational issues, such as not being able to authenticate a route
   origin for the aggregate prefix in new BGP security technologies such
   as those that take advantage of X.509 extensions for IP addresses and
   AS identifiers ([RFC3779], [RFC6480], [RFC6811], [RFC6907],
   [RFC8205], [RFC9319],).  This could result in reachability problems
   for the destinations covered by the aggregated prefix.

   From analysis of historical Internet routing data, it is apparent
   that aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in
   practice on the public Internet ([Analysis]).  When it is used, it is
   often used incorrectly; only a single AS in the AS_SET is the most
   common cases.  Also, very often the same AS appears in the
   AS_SEQUENCE and the AS_SET in the BGP update.  The occurrence of
   reserved AS numbers ([IANA-SP-ASN]) is also somewhat frequent.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommendations

   BGP speakers conforming to this document (i.e., conformant BGP
   speakers) SHOULD NOT locally generate BGP UPDATE messages containing
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  Conformant BGP speakers SHOULD NOT send
   BGP UPDATE messages containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  Upon
   receipt of such messages, conformant BGP speakers SHOULD use the
   "Treat-as-withdraw" error handling behavior as per [RFC7606].

   If a network operator wishes to consider BGP UPDATE messages with
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs received from an external BGP peers, they
   MAY have a feature (knob) in their implementation to do so on a per-
   peer basis.  The operator should understand the full implications of
   choosing this option.

   Network operators SHOULD NOT locally generate any new announcements
   containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.

   BGP security technologies (such as those that take advantage of X.509
   extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers ([RFC3779], [RFC6480],
   [RFC6811], [RFC8205]) might not support routes with AS_SETs or
   AS_CONFED_SETs in them.  Routes with AS_SETs have no possibility of
   ever being considered RPKI-ROV valid [RFC6811] [RFC6907].

4.  Updates to Existing RFCs

   This document deprecates the origination of BGP routes with AS_SET
   (type 1).  ([RFC4271], Section 4.3)

   This document also deprecates the origination of BGP routes with
   AS_CONFED_SET (type 4) AS_PATH segments.  ([RFC5065], Section 3)

   BGP speakers conforming to this document -- i.e., conformant BGP
   speakers -- SHOULD NOT originate BGP UPDATE messages containing
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  Upon receipt of BGP routes containing
   AS_SETs, conformant BGP speakers SHOULD use the "Treat-as-withdraw"
   error handling behavior as per [RFC7606].

4.1.  BGP AS_PATH "Brief" Aggregation

   [RFC4271], Sections 9.1.4 and 9.2.2.2, describes BGP aggregation
   procedures.  [RFC4271], Appendix F.6 describes a generally
   unimplemented "Complex AS_PATH Aggregation" procedure.

   [RFC4271], Section 5.1.6, describing the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path
   Attribute, notes that:

Internet-Draft           AS_SET use deprecation            December 2022


   |  When a BGP speaker aggregates several routes for the purpose of
   |  advertisement to a particular peer, the AS_PATH of the aggregated
   |  route normally includes an AS_SET formed from the set of ASes from
   |  which the aggregate was formed.  In many cases, the network
   |  administrator can determine if the aggregate can safely be
   |  advertised without the AS_SET, and without forming route loops.
   |  
   |  If an aggregate excludes at least some of the AS numbers present
   |  in the AS_PATH of the routes that are aggregated as a result of
   |  dropping the AS_SET, the aggregated route, when advertised to the
   |  peer, SHOULD include the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute.

   When BGP AS_PATH aggregation is done according to the Section 9.2.2.2
   procedures and any resulting AS_SETs are discarded, this is typically
   referred to as "brief" aggreation in implementations.  This results
   in an AS_PATH that has the property (from Section 9.2.2.2):

   |  determine the longest leading sequence of tuples (as defined
   |  above) common to all the AS_PATH attributes of the routes to be
   |  aggregated.  Make this sequence the leading sequence of the
   |  aggregated AS_PATH attribute.

   The ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attribute is subsequently attached to the
   BGP route, if AS_SETs are dropped.

4.2.  Issues with "Brief" AS_PATH Aggregation and RPKI-ROV

   While brief AS_PATH aggregation has the desirable property of not
   containing AS_SETs, the resulting aggregated AS_PATH may contain an
   unpredictable origin AS.  Such an unpredictable origin ASes may
   result in RPKI-ROV validation issues:

   *  Depending on the contributing routes to the aggregate route, the
      resulting origin AS may vary.

   *  The presence of expected contributing routes may be unpredictable
      due to route availability from BGP neighbors.

   *  In the presence of such varying origin ASes, it would be necessary
      for the resource holder to register Route Origin Authorizations
      (ROAs) [RFC6482] for each potential origin AS that may result from
      the expected aggregated AS_PATHs.

4.3.  Recommendations to Mitigate Unpredictable AS_PATH origins for
      RPKI-ROV Purposes

   In order to ensure a consistent BGP origin AS is announced for
   aggregate BGP routes for implementations of "brief" BGP aggregation,
   the implementation should be configured to truncate the AS_PATH after
   the right-most instance of the desired origin AS for the aggregate.

   If the resulting AS_PATH would be truncated from the otherwise
   expected result of BGP AS_PATH aggregation (an AS_SET would be
   generated, or ASes are removed from the "longest leading sequence" of
   ASes), the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attribute SHALL be attached.  This
   is consistent with the intent of Section 5.1.6 of [RFC4271].

5.  Operational Considerations

   When aggregating prefixes, network operators MUST use brief
   aggregation.  In brief aggregation, the AGGREGATOR and
   ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attributes are included, but the AS_PATH does
   not have AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET path segment types.

   When doing the above, operators MUST form the aggregate at the border
   in the outbound BGP policy and omit any prefixes from the AS that the
   aggregate is being advertised to.  In other words, an aggregate
   prefix MUST NOT be announced to the contributing ASes.  Instead, more
   specific prefixes (from the aggregate) MUST be announced to each
   contributing AS, excluding any that were learned from the
   contributing AS in consideration.  See Appendix A for an example of
   this filtering policy.

   Operators MUST install egress filters to block data packets when the
   destination address belongs to an internal prefix.  Similarly, any
   known single-homed customer prefix MUST also be included in the
   egress filters except on the interface for that customer.  This
   mitigates looping in the data plane when connection to such an
   internal or customer prefix is lost.  This mechanism effectively
   compensates for the lack of the additional loop detection capability
   accorded by AS_SETs (if they were allowed).

6.  Security Considerations

   This document obsoletes the use of aggregation techniques that create
   AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs.  Obsoleting these path segment types from
   BGP and removal of the related code from implementations would
   potentially decrease the attack surface for BGP.  Deployments of new
   BGP security technologies ([RFC6480], [RFC6811], [RFC8205]) benefit
   greatly if AS_SETs are not used in BGP.

Appendix B.  Examples of Inconsistent BGP Origin-AS Generated by
             Traditional Brief-Style Aggregation

   AS 64500 aggregates more specific routes into 192.0.2.0/24.

   Consider the following scenarios where brief-style aggregation is
   done by AS 64500 and what the resultant origin ASes would be.

   Routes:
   R1 - 192.0.2.0/26   AS_PATH "64501"
   R2 - 192.0.2.64/26  AS_PATH "64502"
   R3 - 192.0.2.128/26 AS_PATH "64504 64502"
   R4 - 192.0.2.192/26 AS_PATH "64504 64501"


B.1.  Scenario 1: First one route, then another, each with a fully
      disjoint AS_PATH

   Receive R1.  Aggregate 192.0.2.0/24 AS_PATH "64501"

   Alternate "bug?": Aggregate 192.0.2.0/24 AS_PATH "[ 64501 ]"

   Receive R2.  Aggregate 192.0.2.0/24 AS_PATH "[ 64501 64502 ]"

   If brief aggregation is in use, the AS_PATH would be truncated to the
   empty AS_PATH, "".

   The resulting AS_PATH is thus not stable and depends on the presence
   of specific routes.

B.2.  Scenario 2: First one route, then another, the AS_PATHs overlap at
      the origin AS.

   Receive R1.  Aggregate 192.0.2.0/24 AS_PATH "64501"

   Receive R4.  Aggregate 192.0.2.0/24 AS_PATH "64504 [ 64501 ]"

   If brief aggregation is in use, the AS_PATH is truncated to "64504".

   The resulting AS_PATH is thus not stable and depends on the presence
   of specific routes.

B.3.  Scenario 3: First one route, then another, the AS_PATHs overlap at
      the neighbor AS

   Receive R3.  Aggregate 192.0.2.0/24 AS_PATH "64504 64501".

   Receive R4.  Aggregate 192.0.2.0/24 AS_PATH "64504 [ 64501 64502 ]"

   If brief aggregation is in use, the AS_PATH is truncated to "64504".

   The resulting AS_PATH is thus not stable and depends on the presence
   of specific routes.

B.4.  Achieving Consistent Origin-AS During Aggregation

   In the three scenarios above, the aggregating AS 64500 is using
   traditional brief style aggregation.  This results in inconsistent
   origin ASes as the contributing routes are learned.

   The trivial solution to addressing the issue is to simply discard all
   of the ASes for the contributing routes.  In simple BGP aggregation
   topologies, this is likely the correct thing to do.  The AS
   originating the aggregate, 192.0.2.0/24 in this example, is likely
   the resource holder for the route in question.  In such a case,
   simply originating the route to its BGP upstream neighbors in the
   Internet with its own AS, 64500, means that a consistent Route Origin
   Authorization (ROA) could be registered in the RPKI for this prefix.
   This satisfies the need for a consistent origin AS.

   If the contributing ASes are themselves multihomed to the Internet
   outside of their connections to AS 64500, then additional ROAs would
   need to be created for each of the more specific prefixes.

   In more complex proxy aggregation scenarios, there may be a desire to
   permit some stable portion of the contributing AS to be kept in the
   aggregate route.  Consider the case for Scenario 3, where the
   neighbor AS is the same for both R3 and R4 - AS 64504.  In such a
   case, an implementation may permit the aggregate's brief AS_PATH to
   be "64504".
