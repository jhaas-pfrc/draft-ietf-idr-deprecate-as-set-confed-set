    <abstract>
      <t>BCP 172 (i.e., RFC 6472) recommends not using AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET
      AS_PATH segment types in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This document
      advances that recommendation to a standards requirement in BGP; it
      prohibits the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET path segment types
      in the AS_PATH.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation
      of BGP and to make the semantics of the originator of a BGP route clearer.
      This will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of
      various BGP security mechanisms. This document updates RFC 4271 by
      deprecating the origination of BGP routes with AS_SET (Type 1 AS_PATH segment) and
      updates RFC 5065 by deprecating the origination of BGP
      routes with AS_CONFED_SET (Type 4 AS_PATH segment).
      Finally, it obsoletes RFC 6472.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>BCP 172 <xref target="RFC6472"></xref> makes a recommendation for not
      using AS_SET (see <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>) and AS_CONFED_SET (see
      <xref target="RFC5065"></xref>) AS_PATH path segment types in the Border
      Gateway Protocol (BGP).  This document advances the BCP recommendation to
      a standards requirement in BGP; it prohibits the use of the AS_SET and
      AS_CONFED_SET types of path segments in the AS_PATH. The purpose is to
      simplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make the semantics
      of the originator of a BGP route clearer. This will also simplify the design,
      implementation, and deployment of various BGP security mechanisms. In
      particular, the prohibition of AS_SETs and AS_CONFED_SETs removes the
      possibility of ambiguity about origin AS in RPKI-based route origin
      validation (RPKI-ROV)
      <xref target="RFC6811"></xref> <xref target="RFC6907"/>
      <xref target="RFC9319"/>.</t>

      <t> The AS_SET path segment in the AS_PATH attribute (Sections 4.3 and
      5.1.2 of <xref target="RFC4271"></xref>) is created by a router that is
      performing route aggregation and contains an unordered set of Autonomous
      Systems (ASes) that contributing prefixes in the aggregate have
      traversed.</t>

      <t>The AS_CONFED_SET path segment (see <xref target="RFC5065"/>) in
      the AS_PATH attribute is created by a router that is performing route
      aggregation and contains an unordered set of Member AS Numbers in the
      local confederation that contributing prefixes in the aggregate have
      traversed. It is very similar to an AS_SET but is used within a
      confederation.</t>

      <t>By performing aggregation, a router is combining multiple BGP routes
      for more specific destinations into a new route for a less specific
      destination (<xref target="RFC4271"/>, Section 9.1.2.2.). Aggregation
      may blur the semantics of the origin AS for the prefix being announced by
      producing an AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET.  Such sets can cause operational
      issues, such as not being able to authenticate a route origin for the
      aggregate prefix in new BGP security technologies such as those that take
      advantage of X.509 extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers
      (<xref target="RFC6480"/>,
      <xref target="RFC6811"/>, <xref target="RFC6907"/>,
      <xref target="RFC8205"/>, <xref target="RFC9319"/>).
      This could result in reachability problems for the destinations
      covered by the aggregated prefix.</t>

      <t>From analysis of historical Internet routing data, it is apparent that
      aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in practice on the
      public Internet (see <xref target="Analysis"/>).  When it is used, it
      is often used incorrectly; only a single AS in the AS_SET is
      the most common case <xref target="Analysis"/>. Also, very often the same AS appears in the
      AS_SEQUENCE and the AS_SET in the BGP update. The occurrence of reserved
      AS numbers (<xref target="IANA-SP-ASN"/>) is also somewhat frequent.</t>

    <section title="Updates to the Requirements of RFC 4271 and RFC 5065" anchor="recs">

      <t>Unless explicitly configured by a network operator to do otherwise
         (e.g., during a transition phase), BGP speakers:
        <ul>
          <li>MUST NOT advertise BGP UPDATE messages containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs, and</li>
          <li>Upon reception of BGP UPDATE messages containing AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs
              in the AS_PATH or AS4_PATH <xref target="RFC6793"/>, MUST use the "treat-as-withdraw" error handling
              behavior as per <xref target="RFC7606"/>.</li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>Per above specifications, this document updates RFC 4271 and RFC 5065
      by deprecating AS_SET (see <xref target="RFC4271" section="4.3" sectionFormat="comma"/>)
      and AS_CONFED_SET (see <xref target="RFC5065" section="3" sectionFormat="comma"/>), respectively.</t>

    <section title="Treatment of Routes with AS_SET in RPKI-based BGP Security">
      <t>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6480"/> uses X.509
      extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
      RPKI-based Route Origin Validation (ROV) <xref target="RFC6811"/> <xref target="RFC6907"/>
      is a BGP security technology that never allows a route with AS_SET to be considered Valid.
      BGPsec <xref target="RFC8205"/> and Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA)
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification"/> are also BGP security technologies
      based on RPKI. BGPsec does not support AS_SETs. In ASPA-based AS_PATH verification,
      a route with AS_SET is always considered Invalid and hence ineligible for route selection.</t>
    </section>

      <section title="BGP AS_PATH &quot;Brief&quot; Aggregation">
        <t>
      Sections 9.1.4 and 9.2.2.2 of <xref target="RFC4271"/> describe BGP aggregation procedures.
      Appendix F.6 in <xref target="RFC4271"/>
        describes a generally less utilized "Complex AS_PATH Aggregation"
        procedure.</t>

        <t><xref target="RFC4271" section="5.1.6" sectionFormat="comma"/>,
        describing the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attribute, notes that:</t>

        <blockquote>
          <t>When a BGP speaker aggregates several routes for the purpose of
          advertisement to a particular peer, the AS_PATH of the aggregated
          route normally includes an AS_SET formed from the set of ASes from
          which the aggregate was formed.  In many cases, the network
          administrator can determine if the aggregate can safely be advertised
          without the AS_SET, and without forming route loops.</t>

          <t>If an aggregate excludes at least some of the AS numbers present in
          the AS_PATH of the routes that are aggregated as a result of dropping
          the AS_SET, the aggregated route, when advertised to the peer, SHOULD
          include the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute.</t>
        </blockquote>

        <t>When BGP AS_PATH aggregation is done according to the <xref target="RFC4271" section="9.2.2.2" sectionFormat="comma"/>
        procedures, and any resulting AS_SETs are discarded, this is typically
        referred to as "brief" aggregation in implementations.
        Brief aggregation results in an AS_PATH that has the property
        (from <xref target="RFC4271" section="9.2.2.2" sectionFormat="comma"/>):</t>

        <blockquote>
          <t>determine the longest leading sequence of tuples (as defined above)
          common to all the AS_PATH attributes of the routes to be aggregated.
          Make this sequence the leading sequence of the aggregated AS_PATH
          attribute.</t>
        </blockquote>

        <t>The ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attribute is subsequently attached to the
        BGP route, if AS_SETs are dropped.</t>


      <section title="Issues with &quot;Brief&quot; AS_PATH Aggregation and RPKI-ROV">
        <t>While brief AS_PATH aggregation has the desirable property of not
        containing AS_SETs, the resulting aggregated AS_PATH may contain an
        unpredictable origin AS.
        This is because the aggregating AS may be different from the purported origin AS (for the aggregate), which may vary as explained below.
        Such an unpredictable origin ASes may result
        in RPKI-ROV validation issues:</t>

        <ul>
          <li>Depending on the contributing routes to the aggregate route, the
          resulting origin AS may vary.</li>
          <li>The presence of expected contributing routes may be unpredictable
          due to route availability from BGP neighbors.</li>
          <li>In the presence of such varying origin ASes, it would be necessary
          for the resource holder to register Route
          Origin Authorizations (ROAs) <xref target="RFC9582"></xref> for each potential origin AS that
          may result from the expected aggregated AS_PATHs.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section title="Recommendations to Mitigate Unpredictable AS_PATH Origins
       for RPKI-ROV Purposes" anchor="consistent-brief">
        <t>To ensure a consistent BGP origin AS is announced for
        aggregate BGP routes for implementations of "brief" BGP aggregation, the
        implementation MUST be configured to truncate the AS_PATH after the
        right-most instance of the desired origin AS for the aggregate.
        The desired origin AS could be the aggregating AS itself.
        A ROA would be necessary for the aggregate prefix with the desired origin AS.</t>

        <t>This form of brief aggregation is referred to as "consistent
        brief" BGP aggregation.</t>

        <t>If the resulting AS_PATH would be truncated from the otherwise
        expected result of BGP AS_PATH aggregation (an AS_SET would not be
        generated and possibly some ASes are removed from the "longest leading sequence" of
        ASes), the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attribute SHOULD be attached.  This is
        consistent with the intent of <xref target="RFC4271" section="5.1.6" sectionFormat="comma"/>.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Operational Considerations">
    <t>This section provides advice to operators regarding deployment and configuration.</t>
      <section title="Implementing Consistent Brief Aggregation">
        <t>When aggregating prefixes, network operators MUST use
        consistent brief aggregation as described in
        <xref target="consistent-brief"/>.
        In consistent brief aggregation, the AGGREGATOR and ATOMIC_AGGREGATE
        Path Attributes are included, but the AS_PATH does not have AS_SET or
        AS_CONFED_SET path segment types.
        See <xref target="brief-agg-example"/> for examples of
        brief aggregation while keeping the origin AS unambiguous
        and generating appropriate ROAs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Not Advertising Aggregate Routes to Contributing ASes"
       anchor="filtering-to-contributors">
        <t>An aggregate prefix
        SHOULD NOT be announced to the contributing ASes. Instead, more specific
        prefixes (from the aggregate) SHOULD be announced to each contributing AS,
        excluding any that were learned from the contributing AS in
        consideration.  See <xref target="filter-example"/> for an example of
        this filtering policy.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Mitigating Forwarding Loops">
        <t>As discussed in <xref target="RFC4632" section="5.1"/>,
        the presence of both less specific and more specific destinations has
        the possibility to create forwarding loops between networks.</t>

        <t>As a reminder, Rule #2 of <xref target="RFC4632" section="5.1"/>
        requires that BGP implementations performing aggregation discard
        packets that match the aggregate route but do not match any of the
        more-specific routes.
        </t>

        <t>Further discussion of forwarding loops and their relationship to
        AS_SETs can be found in <xref target="forwarding-loop-discussion"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document deprecates the use of aggregation techniques that create
      AS_SETs or AS_CONFED_SETs. Obsoleting these path segment types from BGP
      and removal of the related code from implementations would potentially
      decrease the attack surface for BGP. Deployments of new BGP security
      technologies
      (e.g., <xref target="RFC6480"/>, <xref target="RFC6811"/>,
      <xref target="RFC8205"/>) benefit greatly if AS_SETs and AS_CONFED_SETs are not used in BGP.</t>

       <t>
       Presented here is an illustration of how an AS_SET is not used when
       aggregating and still data-plane route loops are avoided.
       Consider that p1/24 (from AS 64501), p2/24 (from AS 64502), p3/24 (from AS 64503),
       and p4/24 (from AS 64504) are aggregated by AS 64505 to p/22.
       AS_SET is not used with the aggregate p/22 but AGGREGATOR and ATOMIC AGGREGATE are used.
       Data-plane route loops are avoided by not announcing the aggregate p/22
       to the contributing ASes, i.e., AS 64501, AS 64502, AS 64503, and AS 64504.
       Instead, as further illustration, p1/24, p2/24, and p4/24 are announced to AS 64503.

      <section title="Achieving Consistent Origin-AS During Aggregation">
        <t>In the three scenarios above, the aggregating AS 64500 is using
        traditional brief aggregation.  This results in inconsistent
        origin ASes as the contributing routes are learned.  This motivates the
        "consistent brief" BGP aggregation mentioned in
        <xref target="consistent-brief"/> and discussed further
        with examples below.</t>

        <t>The trivial solution to addressing the issue is to simply discard
        all of the ASes for the contributing routes. In simple BGP aggregation
        topologies, this is likely the correct thing to do.  The AS originating
        the aggregate, 192.0.2.0/24 in this example, is likely the resource
        holder for the route in question.  In such a case, simply originating
        the route to its BGP upstream neighbors in the Internet with its own
        AS, 64500, means that a consistent Route Origin Authorization (ROA)
        could be registered in the RPKI for this prefix.  This satisfies the
        need for a consistent (unambiguous) origin AS.</t>

        <t>If the contributing ASes are themselves multihomed to the Internet
        outside of their connections to AS 64500, then additional ROAs would
        need to be created for each of the more specific prefixes.</t>

        <t>In more complex proxy aggregation scenarios, there may be a desire
        to permit some stable (i.e., common) portion of the contributing AS_PATHs to be kept in the
        aggregate route.  Consider the case for Scenario 3, where the neighbor
        AS is the same for both R3 and R4 - AS 64504.  In such a case, an
        implementation may permit the aggregate's brief AS_PATH to be "64504", and
        a ROA would be created for the aggregate prefix with 64504 as the origin AS.

    <section title="Discussion on Forwarding Loops and AS_SETs"
     anchor="forwarding-loop-discussion">
      <t>Although BGP-4 was designed to carry CIDR routes,
      <xref target="RFC4271"/> does not discuss the installation of "discard"
      or "null" routes when implementing its aggregation procedures.  Implementations
      could originate an aggregate prefix without a covering route
      for a more-specific prefix (subsumed by the aggregate prefix) present in the local
      routing table.</t>

      <t>When aggregating more specific routes according to
      <xref target="RFC4271"/> aggregation procedures, the aggregating BGP
      speaker will place contributing routes into the generated AS_PATH, perhaps
      using AS_SETs.  As a result, a contributing AS will not install the
      aggregated route into its RIB since the route is an AS_PATH loop.  This
      provides a form of protection against forwarding loops created by BGP
      aggregation.</t>

      <t>When brief aggregation methods are used, a BGP speaker may receive a
      route containing such less specific destination covering a local more
      specific destination and install it in its routing table since it is not
      prevented from doing so by BGP AS_PATH loop detection. This gives rise to
      the possibility of forwarding loops. To help prevent forwarding loops,
      it is critical to adhere to the following:</t>
        <ol>
          <li>Rule #2 of <xref target="RFC4632" section="5.1"/>:
          "A router that generates an aggregate route for multiple,
          more-specific routes must discard packets that match the
          aggregate route, but not any of the more-specific routes.  In other
          words, the "next hop" for the aggregate route should be the null
          destination."</li>
          <li> Not advertising aggregate routes to contributing ASes
          as specified in <xref target="filtering-to-contributors"/>
          of this document (also see <xref target="filter-example"/>).</li>
