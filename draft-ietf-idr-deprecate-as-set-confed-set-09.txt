                      Deprecation of AS_SET in BGP
             draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-set-confed-set-09

Abstract

   BCP 172 (i.e., RFC 6472) recommends not using AS_SET and
   AS_CONFED_SET in the Border Gateway Protocol.  This document advances
   this recommendation to a standards requirement in BGP; it proscribes
   the use of the AS_SET type of path segments in the AS_PATH.  This is
   done to simplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make the
   semantics of the originator of a route clearer.  This will also
   simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of various BGP
   security mechanisms.  This document (if approved) updates RFC 4271
   and RFC 5065, and obsoletes RFC 6472.

1.  Introduction

   BCP 172 [RFC6472] makes a recommendation for not using AS_SET (see
   [RFC4271]) and AS_CONFED_SET (see [RFC5065]) in the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP).  This document advances the BCP recommendation to a
   standards requirement in BGP; it proscribes the use of the AS_SET
   types of path segments in the AS_PATH.

   The AS_SET path segment in the AS_PATH attribute (Sections 4.3 and
   5.1.2 of [RFC4271]) is created by a router that is performing route
   aggregation and contains an unordered set of Autonomous Systems
   (ASes) that contributing prefixes in the aggregate have traversed.

   By performing aggregation, a router is combining multiple BGP routes
   for more specific destinations into a new route for a less specific
   destination.  ([RFC4271], Section 9.1.2.2.)  Aggregation may blur the
   semantics of the origin AS for the prefix being announced by
   producing an AS_SET.  AS_SETs can cause operational issues, such as
   not being able to authenticate a route origin for the aggregate
   prefix in new BGP security technologies such as those that take

   advantage of X.509 extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers
   ([RFC3779], [RFC6480], [RFC6811],[RFC6907], [RFC8205]).  This in turn
   could result in reachability problems for the aggregated prefix and
   its components; i.e., more specific prefixes.

   From analysis of historical Internet routing data, it is apparent
   that aggregation that involves AS_SETs is very seldom used in
   practice on the public Internet [Analysis].  When it is used, it is
   often used incorrectly; only a single AS in the AS_SET are by far the
   most common cases.  Also, very often the same AS appears in the
   AS_SEQUENCE and the AS_SET in the BGP update.  The occurrence of
   reserved AS numbers ([IANA-SP-ASN]) is also somewhat frequent.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommendations

   BGP speakers conforming to this document (i.e., conformant BGP
   speakers) SHOULD NOT locally generate BGP UPDATE messages containing
   AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET.  Conformant BGP speakers SHOULD NOT send BGP
   UPDATE messages containing AS_SETs.  Upon receipt of such messages,
   conformant BGP speakers SHOULD use the "Treat-as-withdraw" error
   handling behavior as per [RFC7606].

   If a network operator wishes to consider BGP UPDATE messages with
   AS_SETs received from an external BGP peers, they MAY have a feature
   (knob) in their implementation to do so on a per-peer basis.  The
   operator should understand the full implications of choosing this
   option.

   Network operators SHOULD NOT locally generate any new announcements
   containing AS_SETs.

   BGP security technologies (such as those that take advantage of X.509
   extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers ([RFC3779], [RFC6480]
   [RFC6811], [RFC8205]) might not support routes with AS_SETs or
   AS_CONFED_SETs in them.  [RFC6907], Sections 7.1.8 - 7.1.12
   recommends that routes containing AS_SETs be considered RPKI Invalid.

4.  Updates to Existing RFCs

   This document deprecates the origination of BGP routes with AS_SET
   (type 1) AS_PATH segments.  ([RFC4271], Section 4.3.)  BGP speakers
   conforming to this document -- i.e., conformant BGP speakers --
   SHOULD NOT originate BGP UPDATE messages containing AS_SETs.  Upon
   receipt of BGP routes containing AS_SETs, conformant BGP speakers
   SHOULD use the "Treat-as-withdraw" error handling behavior as per
   [RFC7606].

4.1.  BGP AS_PATH "Brief" Aggregation

   [RFC4271], Sections 9.1.4 and 9.2.2.2, describes BGP aggregation
   procedures.  [RFC4271], Appendix F.6 describes a generally
   unimplemented "Complex AS_PATH Aggregation" procedure.

   [RFC4271], Section 5.1.6 describing the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path
   Attribute notes that:

   |  When a BGP speaker aggregates several routes for the purpose of
   |  advertisement to a particular peer, the AS_PATH of the aggregated
   |  route normally includes an AS_SET formed from the set of ASes from
   |  which the aggregate was formed.  In many cases, the network
   |  administrator can determine if the aggregate can safely be
   |  advertised without the AS_SET, and without forming route loops.
   |  
   |  If an aggregate excludes at least some of the AS numbers present
   |  in the AS_PATH of the routes that are aggregated as a result of
   |  dropping the AS_SET, the aggregated route, when advertised to the
   |  peer, SHOULD include the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute.

   When BGP AS_PATH aggregation is done according to the Section 9.2.2.2
   procedures and any resulting AS_SETs are discarded, this is typically
   referred to as "brief" aggreation in implementations.  This results
   in an AS_PATH that has the property (from Section 9.2.2.2):

   |  determine the longest leading sequence of tuples (as defined
   |  above) common to all the AS_PATH attributes of the routes to be
   |  aggregated.  Make this sequence the leading sequence of the
   |  aggregated AS_PATH attribute.

   The ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attribute is subsequently attached to the
   BGP route, if AS_SETs are dropped.

4.2.  Issues with "Brief" AS_PATH Aggregation and RPKI

   While brief AS_PATH aggregation has the desirable property of not
   containing AS_SETs, the resulting aggregated AS_PATH may contain an
   unpredictable origin AS.  Such an unpredictable origin ASes may
   result in RPKI validation issues:

   *  Depending on the contributing routes to the aggregate route, the
      resulting origin AS may vary.

   *  The presence of expected contributing routes may be unpredictable
      due to route availability from BGP neighbors.

   *  In the presence of such varying origin ASes, it would be necessary
      for the resource holder to register Route Origin Authorizations
      (ROAs) [RFC6482] for each potential origin AS that may result from
      the expected aggregated AS_PATHs.

4.3.  Recommendations to Mitigate Unpredictable AS_PATH origins for RPKI
      Purposes

   In order to ensure a consistent BGP origin AS is announced for
   aggregate BGP routes for implementations of "brief" BGP aggregation,
   the implementation should be configured to truncate the AS_PATH after
   the right-most instance of the desired origin AS for the aggregate.

   If the resulting AS_PATH would be truncated from the otherwise
   expected result of BGP AS_PATH aggregation (an AS_SET would be
   generated, or ASes are removed from the "longest leading sequence" of
   ASes), the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path Attribute SHALL be attached.  This
   is consistent with the intent of Section 5.1.6 of [RFC4271].

5.  Operational Considerations

   When aggregating prefixes, network operators MUST use brief
   aggregation.  In brief aggregation, the AGGREGATOR attribute is
   included but the AS_SET attribute is not included.














Kumari, et al.            Expires 24 April 2023                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           AS_SET use deprecation             October 2022


   When doing the above, operators MUST form the aggregate at the border
   in the outbound BGP policy and omit any prefixes from the AS that the
   aggregate is being advertised to.  In other words, an aggregate
   prefix MUST NOT be announced to the contributing ASes.  Instead, more
   specific prefixes (from the aggregate) MUST be announced to each
   contributing AS, excluding any that were learned from the
   contributing AS in consideration.  For illustration, if p1/24 (from
   AS1), p2/24 (from AS2), p3/24 (from AS3) and p4/24 (from AS4) are
   aggregated to p/22, then p/22 will not be announced to AS1, AS2, AS3,
   or AS4.  Instead, as further illustration, p1/24, p2/24 and p4/24 are
   announced to AS3.  Or, possibly q/23 (aggregate of p1/24 and p2/24)
   and p4/24 are announced to AS3.

   Operators MUST install egress filters to block data packets when the
   destination address belongs to an internal prefix.  Similarly, any
   known single-homed customer prefix MUST also be included in the
   egress filters except on the interface for that customer.  This
   mitigates looping in the data plane when connection to such an
   internal or customer prefix is lost.  This mechanism effectively
   compensates for the lack of the additional loop detection capability
   accorded by AS_SETs (if they were allowed).

6.  Security Considerations

   This document obsoletes the use of aggregation techniques that create
   AS_SETs.  Obsoleting these path segment types from BGP and removal of
   the related code from implementations would potentially decrease the
   attack surface for BGP.  Deployments of new BGP security technologies
   ([RFC6480], [RFC6811], [RFC8205]) benefit greatly if AS_SETs are not
   used in BGP.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
